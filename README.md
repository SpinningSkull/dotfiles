# Super minimalist i3WM dotfiles

## **:wave: Welcome**

### Welcome to my dotfiles, I'm Joel from Catalonia, Spain.

📥 I am publishing these dotfiles based on i3wm, which are installed on Debian Kali Linux. The dependencies are:

| Name          | Link                                         |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Kitty**         | https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty      |
| **Powerlevel10k** | https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k |
| **Picom**         | https://github.com/yshui/picom           |
| **I3wm**          | https://github.com/i3/i3                 |

🌻 I created these dotfiles with the intention of creating a super lightweight, functional desktop that is not complicated to install.

🎦 Here is the preview ;)
